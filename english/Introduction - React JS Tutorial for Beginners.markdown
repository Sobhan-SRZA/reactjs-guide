# Introduction - React JS Tutorial for Beginners

## Welcome and Course Objectives
Welcome to the **React JS for Beginners** tutorial! This guide is designed to introduce you to the core concepts and practical applications of **React JS**, especially if you're new to JavaScript. Our goal is to guide you from basic JavaScript concepts to building modern web applications using React and **TypeScript** through simple language and hands-on examples.

In this guide, we'll start with a review of JavaScript, Node.js, and TypeScript to establish a strong foundation for learning React. Then, we'll dive into core React concepts and walk you through building interactive applications step-by-step. This guide is tailored for those who prefer practical, project-based learning.

## Prerequisites and How to Use This Guide
### Prerequisites
To maximize your learning experience, you should have basic familiarity with:
- **JavaScript**: Variables, functions, arrays, and objects.
- **HTML & CSS**: Web page structure and styling.
- **Development Environment**: A code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) and a web browser (Chrome or Firefox recommended).

Don’t worry if you're unfamiliar with these! Early chapters include a JavaScript review to prepare you for React.

### How to Use
- **Guide Structure**: Each chapter includes explanations, code examples, and hands-on exercises. We encourage you to run the example code yourself.
- **Exercises**: End-of-chapter exercises reinforce concepts through practice.
- **Additional Resources**: Supplementary learning materials are provided at the end.
- **Tools**: **Node.js** and a code editor are required. Installation guides are included in later chapters.

### Why React and TypeScript?
React is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries for building interactive UIs. Combining it with TypeScript helps you write cleaner, more maintainable code with fewer errors. This guide prepares you for modern web development.

Let’s begin! In the next chapter, we’ll review JavaScript to build a solid foundation for React.
