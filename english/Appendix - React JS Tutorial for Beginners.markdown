## Frequently Asked Questions and Answers
### 1. Why use TypeScript with React?
TypeScript adds static typing, reducing runtime errors and improving code autocompletion in editors. It’s especially useful in large projects, making code more maintainable and readable.

### 2. What’s the difference between `useState` and `useReducer`?
- `useState` is ideal for managing simple state (e.g., a number or string).
- `useReducer` is better for complex state logic with multiple steps (e.g., managing a list or complex form).

### 3. How can I improve the performance of a React application?
- Use `useMemo` and `useCallback` to avoid unnecessary computations and renders.
- Optimize components with `React.memo`.
- Manage API requests with caching (e.g., React Query).
- Analyze performance using tools like Lighthouse.

### 4. Do I need to master JavaScript before learning React?
Basic familiarity with JavaScript (variables, functions, arrays, and DOM manipulation) is sufficient. Chapter 1 of this tutorial covered JavaScript essentials to provide the necessary prerequisites.

### 5. How can I work with real APIs?
- Use libraries like `axios` or `fetch` to make requests.
- Practice with mock APIs like [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).
- For real projects, refer to your server’s API documentation and use tools like Postman to test APIs.

### 6. How should I test my React projects?
- Use Jest for unit tests and React Testing Library for UI tests.
- Write tests that simulate user behavior (e.g., clicks or data input).
- Check test coverage with the command `npm test -- --coverage`.
